      <h2>20240817: Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My main goal with bebop.nekoweb.org is to create a 3D, interactive
        exploration experience similar to the
        <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Outernet">outernet</a>
        scene from Cowboy Bebop:
      </p>

      <p>
        In the original, I assume that most of those 2D windows are sites you can
        visit. In my version of the outernet, each of these windows is going to be
        an actual <a href="https://nekoweb.org">Nekoweb</a> site. You'll be able
        to click on the window to visit that Nekoweb site.
      </p>
      <p>
        How to get a screenshot of each Nekoweb site? This part is already done
	      for me. On <a href="https://nekoweb.org/explore">nekoweb.org/explore</a>
	      you can see that most sites already have a generated screenshot. The URL
	      follows the pattern of <code>https://nekoweb.org/screenshots/&lt;username&gt;/index_large.jpg</code>
        where <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> is a Nekoweb username.
	      <a href="https://nekoweb.org/screenshots/bebop/index_large.jpg">https://nekoweb.org/screenshots/bebop/index_large.jpg</a>
	      should give you the screenshot for <code>bebop.nekoweb.org</code> for example:
      </p>
      <img src="https://nekoweb.org/screenshots/bebop/index_large.jpg"/>
      <p>
        For the interactive 3D experience I'm going to use Three.js. The docs provide
	      an example that seems very close to what I need:
	      <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_cubes_gpu">
          https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_cubes_gpu
        </a>.

      <h2>20240818: Screenshots</h2>
      <p>
        Getting the screenshots for Nekoweb sites wasn't as easy as hoped. The CORS
        policy on the <code>https://nekoweb.org/screenshots/&lt;username&gt;/index_large.jpg</code>
        images is set to <code>https://nekoweb.org</code> which meant that
        <code>https://bebop.nekoweb.org</code> scripts aren't allowed to fetch those
        resources. So instead I just download my own copies of these images when I
        build the site. I maybe could have asked the Nekoweb maintainers to loosen up the
        CORS policy on these images but I wanted to just get this boring stuff over with.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I did get permission to use these screenshots. I proposed
        the outernet idea on the Nekoweb Discord and dimden said
        "you probably can if it's done nicely".
      </p>
      <p>
        I also had to switch over to a deploy workflow based on GitHub Actions.
        It took a while to get the big file API working but it's all good now.

        Basic UX is now working!

      <h2>20240819: Archives</h2>
      <p>
        I went down a small rabbithole trying to get the site working on the Wayback
	      Machine. I wanted to take snapshots as the site progresses. Turns out the
	      Wayback Machine is really bad at handling JS imports. That's annoying. I guess
	      I'll just do some screencasts from time to time.

      <h2>20240820: Fish art</h2>
      <p>
        The original outernet has a bunch of fun fish floating around. Not
        sure how I'll recreate those.
